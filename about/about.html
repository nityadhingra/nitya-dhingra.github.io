           <li>Hi! Welcome to my website:) I have put together some of my projects and assignments that I have recently worked on as well as some other little bits and pieces that tell you a little bit more about me.</li>

           <li>I am a Communication Design major at the Parsons School of Design. I love to use the various applications in Adobe Creative Cloud and create design related work in different mediums.</li>

           <li>I am also extremely passionate about the environment and sustainability and have worked with the Protect Our Planet Movement,
            using design to help bring about positive changes in the world.</li>
            
           <li>I love exploring and traveling to new places, learning new things and taking photgraphs.</li>
